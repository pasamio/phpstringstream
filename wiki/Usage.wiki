#summary Usage information on how to use the wrapper

= Introduction =

The String Stream Wrapper is comprised of two classes: a string stream wrapper class and a simple controller class. The wrapper is registered to handle requests and the controller class is used to create references to strings so that it can be proxied to the wrapper.

Please note that it is necessary to to create a reference first and that 
reference will always point to the same string, which includes any 
modifications you make to the string. 

= Sample code =
{{{
require('stringstream.php');
$mystring = "This,is,a,CSV,string";
StringStreamController::createRef('reference',$mystring);
$file = fopen('string://reference');
while($row = fgetcsv($file)) {
   print_r($row);
   echo '<br />';
}
fclose($file);
}}}

$file is now a file handle, you can use this for any function that requests a
file handle, such as fgetcsv in this example.
