#summary Project motivation

I was mentoring for Summer of Code and my student asked me if I had any decent 
code for parsing a CSV string. I didn't, but noticed that there was a PHP 
function that would, fgetcsv. The problem being in this case that the CSV
file was already in a PHP string. I looked at the built-in "data" stream
which provides similar functionality (but not the same!) however an fopen
with it causes a duplication of data for the string, which really isn't
good. Additionally, the "data" stream requires the information to be in a 
certain format which may or may not be acceptable in certain circumstances. So 
I searched on how to make a stream, found the page noted at the bottom which 
is an Amazon S3 Stream Wrapper and made my own stream.   

Whilst a bit 'clunky' compared to most streams, it solves the problem, with
approximately 1k of memory usage (which if you have a large CSV file, is a
really smaller number). The alternative was to use a PHP written CSV parser or
to put it into a file. I feel that this solution is nicer.
